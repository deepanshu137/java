	<p>Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, <strong>in 1995.James Gosling</strong> and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

Currently, <strong>Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc.</strong> There are given significant points that describe the history of Java</p>

	<h1>Where <strong>Java</strong> is used </h1>
	<details>
		One of the most striking features of Java for desktop applications is that it provides GUI (Graphic User Interface) development which is popularly implemented by software such as AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit), Swing and JavaFX.

AWT contains several components such as a menu, button, list, and many third-party components. Swing components are lightweight, it provides more powerful components such as tables, lists, scroll panes, color chooser, tabbed pane, etc. JavaFX is a set of graphics and media packages, provides interoperability, 3D graphics features, and self-contained deployment model. ThinkFree is one of the examples of Desktop based application.

		Several companies run on software developed using Java. C and C++ language have become obsolete. Java is versatile and easy to implement, as it does not involve the use of pointers. In the banking sector also have Java is running from front end to back end. The higher performance guarantee Java has resulted in high-frequency trading systems like Murex to be scripted in the language. It is also the backbone for a variety of banking applications which have Java running from front user end to back server end.

		Java provides support for web applications through Servlets, Struts or JSPs. With the help of these technologies, we can develop any kind of web application.

There are certain programs called applets that are embedded alongside the web pages which work on the client-side. It is associated with a short HTML text file. It has found new applications in the field of E-commerce as well which is being implemented with Broadleaf, an open-source software.

	<details>
		Cloud computing refers to the usage of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data instead of using a local computer network. It is a platform that is used for a distributed computing system.

There is a wide range of Java Cloud development tools like Oracle Java cloud service which serves as a platform to create and configure an Oracle WebLogic Server and the application environment without any hassle.

		J2ME is a cross-platform framework to build applications that run across all Java supported devices, including smartphones. Given the fact that the Android framework is closely associated with Java, Android apps can be designed on easy terms using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and other such environments.

		Whenever you lose your internet connection, you might have encountered this popular dinosaur game and might have given it shot a couple of times.

Ever wondered if you could program this game too using Java? Java is one of the best platforms to develop 2D Games. Since gaming is followed by animation, you can create your personalized version of the dinosaur game by coupling Java with CSS.

	<h1>Advantages of JAVA</h1>
	<p>
	#Java is easy to learn<br>
#Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages<br>

#Java is object-oriented<br>
This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code<br>

#Java is platform-independent<br>
#One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels<br>

	<h1>Disadvantages of python</h1>
	<P> 
Since Java Programs run on top of Java Virtual Machine, it consumes more memory<br>


Since memory and processing requirements higher, hardware cost increases<br>


There is no support for low level programming in Java, like pointers are missing<br>


There is no control over garbage collection in Java. That is programmer does not have any right to control the garbage collection. Java does not provide functions like delete(), free()<br>

 Java does not support unsigned int, unsigned char, â€¦ etc. However in Java 8, API for unsigned long and unsigned int is introduced (Please see this oracle doc)<br>
